# audioClassification_deepLearningModels

The dataset employed for this study is made of many artificial audio samples, where 30 different words are pronounced. The objective of this project is performing a Speech Classification: the problem is approached by building deep learning models that take as input a sequence and return 30 different answers (probabilities of the input being one of the 30 words), and therefore we aim to develop a multiclass classification.
